# Cromemco-Dazzler

Gerbers for the Cromemco Dazzler boards

This repositry contains two archives containing Gerber files for a replica of the Cromemco Dazzler S100 video card. 

This will require the original vintage components to construct.

PCB artwork was created by Hugo Holden of the Vintage Computer Federation and the PCB layout created by myself.

These have not yet been tested.
