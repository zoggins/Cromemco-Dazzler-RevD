Production hints Cromemco Dazzler Rev D replica PCB 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------

In order to achieve best a possible match with the original Cromemco Dazzler,
try to select the following options for production:

- Select green 2 layer PCB with thickness 1.6 and white silk screen (normally
  standard)

- Select "tented" for via covering for Dazzler board #1, and "untented" via
  covering for Dazzler board #2. Covering should be done with solder mask.
  I recommend to ask explicitely for vias covered with solder mask for
  board #1, otherwise you may or may not receive the expected outcome.

- Make sure the manufacturer is capable of gold plating the PCB fingers only.
  Most manufacturers are only able to use ENIG or HASL for the whole board.
  
- Make sure the silkscreen printing is enabled also on the openings of the
  solder mask. Most manufacturers by default will print on the solder mask only,
  so that parts of the silkscreen like the Cromemco Logo will be removed.
  
- Make sure any extra printings (beyond silkscreen) are deselected (e.g. serial
  numbers, order numbers, bar codes etc.)
  
I recommend contact fingers to be chamfered, so that the PCB better fits into
the mainboard socket.

None of the above options (except thickness) has relevance for functionality.
Not every manufacturer offers all of the above options, you probably also have
to make your choice on economy vs. accuracy.
